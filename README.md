## About
This is an Epicodus project for the Ruby TDD Assessment.
The project checks a series of numbers, such as those found on a transport ticket, and determines if it is lucky.
Luck is determined by separating each half of the number and adding their respective digits together.
If the sum of each independent half equals each other, the ticket is considered lucky, and vice versa.
